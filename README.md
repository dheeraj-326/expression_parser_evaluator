# Expression Parser and Evaluator

## Thanks
This repository and the ones which are about to appear in my Github profile from today would not have been possible without my guru and mentor Praseed Pai https://github.com/praseedpai. This particular piece of work is inspired by https://github.com/praseedpai/SOLIDTOLIQUIDver1.0/tree/main/CSharp/part02

## What is this?
This is a very simple parser and evaluator for mathematical expression which supports +, -, * and / alongwith ( and ). What is the big deal about it? This demonstrated the basics of compiler design as you can see how I am building an abstract syntax tree and doing recursive descent parsing to evaluate the expression.
